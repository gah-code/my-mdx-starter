# Syntax Highlighting in MDX

Hereâ€™s a code block:

```js
// This is JavaScript code
const greet = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greet('Gatsby'));
```

When you view this page, the code block should be syntax highlighted according to the **prism.css** theme you imported.
